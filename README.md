# 🚚 Predictive Maintenance Model for a Delivery Company

This project focuses on building a predictive maintenance classification model to anticipate potential vehicle failures in a delivery fleet. Early prediction helps reduce downtime, lower maintenance costs, and improve operational efficiency.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Using historical vehicle data and sensor readings, we train classification models to predict whether a vehicle is likely to require maintenance soon.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict potential maintenance needs using classification algorithms.
- Reduce unscheduled breakdowns and optimize maintenance scheduling.
- Improve fleet reliability and cost-efficiency.

## 📁 Files
